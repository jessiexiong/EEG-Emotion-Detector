# EEG-Emotion-Detector

Files are split between ML model and openBCI data manipulation!

### Organization
1. Download pycharm for python development.
2. Clone repo with:
`git clone https://github.com/jessiexiong/EEG-Emotion-Detector.git`

3. Make sure new changes are made on a branch that isn't main, 
use `git checkout -b <branch-name>` to create a new branch after cloning.

4. After creating a new branch run:
`git push` and a long command that looks sort of like `git push --set-upstream blah blah blah`
will appear, copy that and paste it into the command window. This way, any changes will need 
go through a pull request review before being pulled into master.

5. Make any changes on your branch
